# Womper ECommerce by Eric Garcia and Alec Burns
Use the following to reproduce our repository:

1. https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/build-react-app-amplify-graphql/ - Use the following tutorial. When prompted to clone a git repository use the repository link for Womper instead.

2. Create an AWS account, follow the tutorial, and configure permissions in the AWS console as needed.

3. That's it! Check for console errors if needed, but the site should work out of the box with your own database. Review AWS documentation as needed.
